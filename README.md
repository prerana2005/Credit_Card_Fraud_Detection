# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project implements a machine learning-based **Credit Card Fraud Detection System** using **Logistic Regression**. It effectively detects fraudulent transactions with high accuracy using real-world anonymized transaction data.

---

## Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using statistical preprocessing and logistic regression. The model achieves up to **93% accuracy** on the test dataset and is a lightweight, reliable baseline for fraud detection tasks.

## Features

-  **Machine Learning Model**: Trained using `LogisticRegression` from `scikit-learn`
-  **High Accuracy**: Achieves ~93% test accuracy
-  **Data Preprocessing**: Includes downsampling, normalization, and correlation filtering
-  **Fraud Detection**: Helps improve financial security through fraud prediction

##  Dataset

The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle: Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013 and is heavily imbalanced (0.17% fraud).
